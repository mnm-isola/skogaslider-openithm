# WIP DO NOT USE

Skogaslider PCB designed as a drop in replacement for existing Openithm controller

With a RP2040-Zero, 3 MPR121 breakout modules and a 74HC4051 breakout module

Should have compatibility with analog air towers and digital air towers.

6 pots for adjusting photodiodes instead of trying through different resistor values.
